# Foreword

Unros was created after I faced several issues with `rclpy` and eventually reached my breaking point. In one week I had drafted this framework, and I have been developing it in my ideal image ever since. I am simply a student who learned Rust on their own; There isn't even a class at my university for it. As such, developing this framework also served as an exercise in my understanding of this language as much as it has served the club as a formidable competitor to the often used ROS framework from years prior.

I agree that people who are familiar with ROS should stick with ROS instead of burdening themselves with learning this framework. However, if you are new to robotics and Rust, this framework should not be a  bad choice. On top of this, the robotics club is also actively using this framework and correcting it through active practice, so there will be continued maintenance and development for several years.

Finally, one could argue that a monopoly on robotics software, despite being open source, is still not a good thing and can get in the way of finding key innovations in the way we do robotics, so this framework serves that purpose as well. While we do intend to follow ROS in the places that it does well, we certainly are open in introducing breaking changes at this stage to find the best ways to program robots.
